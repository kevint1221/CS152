I haven't tested every files
Known bugs:
	- continue does not work properly
	- call sometime  doesn't output correctly
	- return does not work properly
	- not sure how the for loop should be output since there are no example in fib/mytest/primes files

Sorry for the bugs, I already tried my best. If I have more time I would finish it.

Makefile create a parser that can generate mil file
Make clean cleans all generated file include mil file
script.sh is the bash file that I wrote to run all the command to generate mil file
input.txt/input2.txt is for run_mil

Best,
